# Exercises

## Basic setup and Unix familiarity

You will need access to a Unix shell for HPPS.  Read the [Unix
software guide](../../unix.md).

After reading and following the guide, open a terminal with a Unix
shell.  When illustrating a shell command, we will write it like this:

```
$ echo HPPS is my favourite course
HPPS is my favourite course
```

The `$` is not part of the input you type, but a stand-in for the
command prompt.  On the line after the command (the `echo ...` part),
we may put the output of the command.  When we tell you to run a
command, we will often not show the output, but merely tell you to run
e.g:

```
$ echo HPPS is the favourite course of $USER
```

If you have no experience with using a command prompt, then you might
want to read (part of) [this text on Unix-Like Data
Processing](uldp17-2018-08-16.pdf), which also contains some
exercises. If you don't like this text, then the Internet contains
thousands of tutorials and guides on how to use a Unix shell, all of
which are a [search engine
query](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=how+do+i+unix&ia=web) away. You
do not need to be a command prompt expert to succeed in HPPS, but you
should understand the following:

* The general tree structure of the file system.

* How to move between directories (`cd`) and see their contents (`ls`).

* How to view file contents from a command line (`cat`, `less`, etc).

* How to copy files (`cp`).

* How to move/rename files (`mv`).

* How to delete files and directories (`rm`).

## Compiling C programs

You will be doing a lot of C programming in HPPS, so you need to make
sure you can compile C code.  You are not expected to understand what
the C code *does* yet.

Copy the file [guess.c](src/guess.c) to a directory on your computer, open
a Unix terminal, and navigate to the directory containing `guess.c`.  Then run:

```
$ gcc guess.c -o guess
```

This will compile the C program and generate a binary called `guess`.
Now run the `./guess` program and complete the game:

```
$ ./guess
OK, I am thinking of a number in the range [0,99] - see if you can guess it!
Type a number and press enter to make a guess.
42
Too high!
...
```

While you don't know C yet, you can still try the following (optional)
exercises to modify the `guess.c` program.  Remember that you have to
re-run the `gcc` command after making a modification!

* Make the program print a more insulting message when the player guesses wrong.

* Change the range from which the random number is drawn.

* Make the program cheat, so that it changes the number it is thinking
  of when it would otherwise have been guessed.
