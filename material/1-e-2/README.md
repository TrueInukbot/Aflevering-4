# Exercises

The main purpose of the following exercises is to give you more
experience with programming in C, as well as prepare you for A1 (the
first mandatory assignment). They mostly consist of setting up a
working C development environment (compiler, editor), which you will
need today.

For the coding exercises, you should use `make` to build your
programs. To parametrize `make` to build with all the necessary
compiler flags, start by writing down a `Makefile` containing the
following:

```
CC?=cc
CFLAGS?=-std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -g
```

Then when you add a program `foo`, add a rule to `Makefile` as
follows:

```
foo: foo.c
	$(CC) -o foo foo.c $(CFLAGS)
```

**Beware**: the leading whitespace *must* be a single tab character,
*not* multiple spaces. If you transcribe it by hand, you may enter the
wrong invisible character (this is not a prank; computers really are
like this).

Now, to compile `foo`, run `make foo`. For example:

```
$ make mynameis
```

There are ways to automate parts of this, but we recommend being
explicit until you get a firm grasp on what `make` does.

In the following, we colloquially use "print" as slang for writing to
standard output.

* [Code handout here](src/)
* [Reference solutions here](ref/)

Remember to check the reference solutions once you've written your
own - perhaps they'll show you ways of doing things more concisely.

## Printing in C

Write a C program `mynameis` that prints your name.

## Input arguments in C

Write a C program `repeatme` that given a string as argument, prints
the string twice on separate lines.  (Maybe watch [the video on
reading line
arguments](https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/f8RgVGzlET/argv.mp4).)

If the program gets a number of arguments that is different from 1 it
should print "`Wrong number of arguments`".

## Input argument validation

Write a C program `noAs` that given a string as argument, does either
of the following.

  * If the first character of the string is the `char` `A` it
    prints "`No beginning A's are allowed`",

  * otherwise it prints the given string.

Reminder: Consider how strings are formatted in C.

Note: reuse your argument validation from before. You can just as well
learn it from the beginning: _always check your inputs._

## Multiple input formats

Modify the `roll` program from the handout to support `dN` as
a shorthand for `1dN`.  Hint: if one `sscanf()` fails, try another.

## Bits, libraries, and tests in C (A1 warmup)

This exercise is essentially a miniature version of A1.  You will
write a small C library for computing with single bits.  A library is
a set of reusable definitions (types and functions) that can be used
by applications.  To keep things simple, we are ignoring some C
library best practices - we'll rectify that in A2.

Our library consists of a *header file* `bits.h` and a *test program*
`test_bits.c`.  The test program uses the definitions of the header
file and tests their correctness.  Both are part of the [code
handout](src/), but are unfinished.

Use `make test_bits` to compile the test program and, indirectly, the library.

### Finishing the library

We represent a bit as a type `struct bit`:

```C
struct bit {
  bool v;
};
```

#### Implement `bit_from_int`

Where we represent a bit 1 as `true` and 0 as `false`.  Implement a function

```C
struct bit bit_from_int(unsigned int x);
```

that turns an integer 1 into a `true` bit and an integer 0 into a
`false` bit.  Do this by defining a variable

```C
struct bit b;
```

then set `b.v` based on the value of the integer `x`, then return `b`.

#### Implement `bit_to_int`

Implement a function

```
unsigned int bit_to_int(struct bit b);
```

that turns a `struct bit` into a C integer (that is, the inverse of
`bit_from_int`).

#### Implement `bit_print`

Implement a function

```
void bit_print(struct bit b);
```

that prints a `true` bit as 1 and a `false` bit as 0.

#### Implement `bit_not`

Implement a function

```
struct bit bit_not(struct bit a);
```

that given a bit `x` returns a bit `b` that is the logical negation of
`a`.  This can be implemented similarly to `bit_from_int` by declaring
a new variable of type `struct bit` and then returning it.

#### Implement `bit_and`, `bit_or`, `bit_xor`

Implement the functions

```
struct bit bit_and(struct bit a, struct bit b);
struct bit bit_or(struct bit a, struct bit b);
struct bit bit_xor(struct bit a, struct bit b);
```

with the semantics covered in the lectures.

### Writing the test program

For the purpose of this exercise (and A1), a test program is a program
that uses the facilities exposed by a library (here `bits.h`).  When
run, it calls each function in the library, compares the obtained
result with the expected result, and complains loudly if there is a
discrepancy.  Conventionally, if a test program produces no output,
then the test is assumed to have succeeded.  Extend `test_bits.c` to
test all of the functions you added to `bits.h`.

One of the easiest ways to conduct test is to use the `assert` macro
from the standard `<assert.h>` header.  For example, we could test
`bit_from_int` and `bit_to_int` like this:

```C
assert(bit_to_int(bit_from_int(1)) == 1)
```

One downside of using `assert` is that while it will tell you that the
comparison failed, it will not tell you which result was actually
returned.  This is not such a big concern with bits where only two
values are possible, but it might become a problem in A1.  For testing
something like `bit_and`, we can use a function like this:

```C
void test_bit_and(unsigned int x, unsigned int y) {
  unsigned int got = bit_to_int(bit_and(bit_from_int(x), bit_from_int(y)));
  unsigned int expected = x&y;
  if (got != expected) {
    printf("Input:     %u & %u\n", x, y);
    printf("Got:       %u\n", got);
    printf("Expected:  %u\n", expected);
    exit(1);
  }
}
```

Use similar functions for `test_bit_or` and `test_bit_xor`.

## Integer representation

Play the integer representation game linked below. Try to get `0xA`
correct on the different "levels".

## Integer puzzles

Given the following initialization:

```C
int x = foo();
int y = bar();
unsigned ux = x;
unsigned uy = y;
```

Consider whether each of the following statements hold:

* `x < 0` => `((x*2) < 0)`
* `ux >= 0`
* `x & 7 == 7`  => `(x<<30) < 0`
* `ux > -1`
* `x > y`   =>  `-x < -y`
* `x * x >= 0`
* `x > 0 && y > 0`  =>  `x + y > 0`
* `x >= 0`  =>  `-x <= 0`
* `x <= 0`  =>  `-x >= 0`
* `(x|-x)>>31 == -1`
* `ux >> 3 == ux/8`
* `x >> 3 == x/8`
* `x & (x-1) != 0`
